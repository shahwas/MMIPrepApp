    Your close friend applied to the same medical school as you. While
    celebrating after she receives an interview invitation, she casually
    mentions that she exaggerated a volunteer experience on her
    application — listing six months when she only attended twice. She
    laughs it off, saying "everyone does it." You know the admissions
    committee takes integrity seriously. What do you do?

    You are writing a proctored final exam in a large lecture hall. Midway
    through, you notice the student seated next to you has a small
    piece of paper tucked under their calculator with formulas written on
    it. You make brief eye contact and they quickly cover it. The proctor
    hasn't noticed. This student is a classmate you've studied with all
    semester and you know they've been struggling with family issues.

    A group of physicians at a major urban hospital have announced a
    one-day strike to protest unsafe staffing levels, arguing that
    chronically overworked doctors pose a greater long-term risk to
    patients. The hospital administration calls it irresponsible. Some of
    your colleagues support the strike; others say doctors should never
    walk off the job. Emergency services will still operate, but clinics
    and elective procedures will be cancelled, affecting hundreds of
    patients. What is your position, and how do you justify it?

    You are a family medicine resident. During a routine visit, your
    patient — a 28-year-old man — tells you he was recently diagnosed
    with HIV. He is visibly upset and asks you to keep it completely
    confidential. When you gently ask whether he has informed his
    partner, he becomes agitated and says he hasn't and doesn't plan
    to, because she would leave him. You know his partner is also a
    patient at your clinic. What do you do?

    You are a second-year medical student doing a clinical placement.
    One afternoon, you notice that Dr. Patel, a well-respected staff
    physician, smells strongly of alcohol during afternoon rounds. He
    seems slightly unsteady but is functioning and none of the nurses
    have said anything. A colleague whispers to you, "I think he's just

    You are a graduate researcher in a neuroscience lab. Your
    supervisor has just secured a $2-million grant from a pharmaceutical
    company to study their new antidepressant. During a lab meeting,
    your supervisor casually mentions that the company wants to review
    all findings before publication and has the right to delay results
    they consider "commercially sensitive." Your preliminary data
    suggests the drug may have a serious cardiac side-effect that
    wasn't in their initial safety profile. What do you do?

    frightened and begs you not to tell her parents, explaining that her
    father is very strict and she fears his reaction. She says she wants
    to explore her options. Under the law in your jurisdiction, a mature
    minor can consent to medical treatment, but Maya seems unsure and

    It is the peak of a respiratory virus pandemic. Your ICU has one
    remaining ventilator. Two patients arrive within minutes of each
    other, both in acute respiratory failure. Patient A is a 32-year-old
    mother of two young children with no comorbidities. Patient B is a
    68-year-old retired nurse who volunteered to come back and help
    during the pandemic and contracted the virus while caring for
    patients. The triage protocol at your hospital is based solely on
    likelihood of survival, and both patients have similar prognoses.

    says loudly in front of the patient and two nurses, "Did you
    seriously order a CT without consulting me first? That's completely
    unacceptable." You believe the CT was warranted based on the

    A small city of 80,000 people receives $50 million in provincial
    health funding. They can build a new 100-bed hospital to replace
    their aging facility, or invest the entire amount in community health
    programs — mobile clinics, addiction services, mental health
    outreach, and prenatal care in underserved neighbourhoods. Health
    data shows the community's biggest killers are preventable: heart
    disease, diabetes, and overdose. But the current hospital is
    outdated and wait times are growing. What would you recommend,
    and why?

    You are a medical student doing a handover at shift change. You
    need to communicate a concern about a patient — Mr. Reeves, whose
    blood pressure has been gradually dropping over the past two hours
    — to the incoming resident, who is busy and distracted. Using the
    SBAR framework (Situation, Background, Assessment,
    Recommendation), how would you structure this handover to ensure
    the urgency is clear?

    You are a staff physician at a community hospital. A social worker
    on your team, Janet, confides in you that she doesn't feel her
    input is valued during rounds. She says, "The doctors talk about
    the medical plan and by the time I get to speak, everyone's already
    leaving. My assessment of the patient's housing and support
    situation never gets discussed." You've noticed this pattern too.
    How do you address it?

    You're a medical student who has just completed a clinical
    placement. A patient you worked with, Mrs. Brooks, sends a
    heartfelt thank-you card to the unit addressed to "the team" but
    specifically names the nurse, the physiotherapist, and you — but
    not the resident who led most of the care decisions. The resident
    seems hurt. How do you handle this?

    An interviewer asks you, "What is your single greatest strength,
    and how specifically would it help you as a physician? Don't just
    name it — tell me about a time it made a real difference." Respond
    with a concrete example.

    An interviewer leans forward and says, "Tell me about your biggest
    weakness — not one that's secretly a strength, but something
    you've genuinely struggled with. What have you done about it, and
    how is it going?" Respond honestly.

  prompt: >
    Describe a specific time when you were genuinely outside your
    comfort zone — not slightly uncomfortable, but truly out of your
    depth. What was the situation, what did you learn about yourself,
    and how did the experience change your approach to unfamiliar
    situations?

    Tell me about a time when you were asked a question or faced a
    problem where you genuinely didn't know the answer, and people
    were looking to you for one. How did you handle the uncertainty,
    and what did you learn about how you respond when you're not the
    expert in the room?

  prompt: >
    We all carry biases, often without realizing it. Tell me about a
    specific moment when you became aware of a bias you held — about
    a person, a group, or a situation. What triggered that awareness,
    and what concrete steps have you taken to address it?

    Tell me about a time when someone gave you feedback that you
    initially thought was unfair or wrong. Maybe a professor, a
    supervisor, or a peer. Walk me through your initial reaction, what
    happened next, and how you see that feedback now, looking back.

    Has a personal experience with illness — your own, or that of
    someone close to you — shaped how you think about healthcare?
    Tell me what happened, how it affected you at the time, and how it
    influences the kind of physician you want to be.

    What does professionalism mean to you? Not the textbook
    definition, but your own understanding of it. Can you describe a
    specific moment when you either demonstrated professionalism
    under pressure, or saw someone else fail to, and what you took
    away from it?

    Tell me about a time when doing the right thing was genuinely
    difficult — when it cost you something, or was unpopular, or when
    staying silent would have been easier. What did you do, and how do
    you feel about that decision now?

    If you could go back and change one significant decision you've
    made — academic, personal, or professional — what would it be?
    What would you do differently, what did you learn from how it
    played out, and how has it influenced decisions you've made since?
