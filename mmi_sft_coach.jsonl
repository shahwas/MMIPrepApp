What do you do?\n\n\n104\n\nTHEME(S): ethical dilemma, non-judgmental approach\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nIn this scenario, a classmate has claimed my reading\nsummary as her own, after she approached me before class for help\nunderstanding the day’s readings, which she had not completed due\nto a personal emergency. The professor of the course is also my\nsupervisor, and all 10 students in the course are vying for the\nprofessor’s favor. This is a complicated ethical issue, and while\nfeeling upset about this is a normal reaction, I want to ensure that I’m\nhandling the situation in a way that is mature and appropriate,\nbalancing my own needs with those of my classmate and with those of\nour broader classroom community. There are two competing issues here: academic\nintegrity and the needs of a fellow student in distress. In the immediate context of the class, I would refrain\nfrom disrupting the conversation or calling out my classmate in front\nof others. I’ve put the effort into doing the readings, and there will be\nplenty of opportunities in the next two hours of class time to impress\nmy supervisor and contribute meaningfully to the conversation. I\nknow from the professor’s reaction that my summary was top-notch,\nso that should give me the confidence needed to express further\ninsights or observations during class discussion. At the end of the class,\n105\n\nI would attempt to get my classmate’s attention and ask if I could\nspeak further with her. I would find a private place for us to speak,\nand I would address her in a calm, non-confrontational manner. I would begin by telling her that\nI sympathize with her situation – surely all students have been in a\nsituation in which urgent personal matters got in the way of\ncompleting a course reading, and I’m happy to support my colleagues\nand to foster an ethic of sharing in academia. I would then\nexpress my confusion over her actions in class and ask why she\npresented my ideas as her own, particularly when she hadn’t actually\ndone the reading herself. I would listen\nattentively and actively to her explanation. I would remind her that\nwhat she did would be considered a violation of academic integrity—\nplagiarism—and emphasize that her own learning experience is\ndisrupted by not engaging with the material herself. I would request that she consider confessing\nher actions to the professor; however, for the time being, I would not\npersonally escalate the issue. It’s entirely likely that she was simply\noverwhelmed by the personal issues she’s facing and that she was\nswept up in her desire to impress the professor. So long as this didn’t\nhappen again, I would keep this to myself and focus on putting\ntogether the best work possible for the course. If, however, I came to\nlearn that she had done something like this again, then I would\nconsider bringing this to the attention of the professor.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 1, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"empathy\", \"if/then\", \"solutions\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

Your friend\ncalls you while she’s on the road thanking you for hosting her, what\ndo you say?\n\nTHEME(S): conflict resolution, non-judgmental approach\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nAfter tidying up from a recent visit from one of my\nchildhood friends, I notice one of my necklaces is missing. I\ncannot make any assumptions as to where my necklace has gone, and\nI certainly will not assume that my friend stole the necklace, just\nbecause she had admired it or once shoplifted as a teenager. I would try to clearly think and trace back my steps\nto when I last saw it or had it on. I would try to remain calm and look\n107\n\nfor it in the house. Perhaps I\nmay have misplaced it or lost it over the weekend. Since my friend did\nadmire my necklace, perhaps she remembers the last time I wore it. I\nwould let my friend know that I misplaced my necklace and ask if she\nremembers the last time I wore it. I would need\nto communicate in a non-judgmental way to ensure I am being\nrespectful towards my friend and not compromising our friendship\nwhile still looking for my necklace.\nTogether we can trace back our steps.\nFor example, if the last time was the restaurant, I can return to the\nrestaurant and see if my necklace is there. During my conversation\nwith my friend, if I do sense that my friend took it, or she admits she\ntook it, then I would want to know why she did so without asking.\nPerhaps after she mentioned that she admired it, I may have lent it to\nher and completely forgot. In the worst-case scenario, if my friend did\ntake my necklace without my permission, I would let her know that\nher behavior is not acceptable, and it can affect the trust we have.\nLastly, I would ask her that if she wanted to use or borrow anything\nof mine to simply ask. In summary, I would first search for my missing\nnecklace as I could have misplaced it or lent it to my friend. In the\ncase that she did take it, I would respectfully ask her to not take my\nbelongings without my prior knowledge in the future to maintain our\ntrusting relationship.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 2, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\", \"summary\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

My main concern here is ensuring the\nsafety and wellbeing of my patient, as well as other drivers and\npedestrians on the road. First, I want\nto speak in more detail to my patient. I do not want to make any\nassumptions about the information she has just given me until I\ngather more facts. I\nwill gather a full history from her about her symptoms, this\n109\n\nmedication, when she was prescribed it, and any side effects she has\nnoticed. I will delve into her side effects in detail, asking her when\nthey started and if she has noticed them recently or for a long time. I\nwill also look into her medical history to ensure I understand her full\nstory. I will look up the latest, evidence-based guidelines on how to\ntreat patients with epilepsy, as well as the laws and guidelines in my\njurisdiction for patients with epilepsy driving. Next, I want to speak to\nmy patient. I will stress to her that her health and safety are\nparamount and it’s important to make sure her epilepsy is treated\nappropriately while minimizing side effects. I will tell her that by\ndriving without her epilepsy being managed appropriately, others on\nthe road can also be affected. I will also stress the importance of sharing this information\nwith Dr. Singh, as he is my patient’s physician and is more\nexperienced than me. Furthermore, I’ll emphasize that prescribing\nany course of action is outside of my expertise and scope of practice.\nHowever, to maintain trust with my patient, I will tell her that we can\ntell Dr. Singh together. She can share her concerns about her current\nmedication, and I can support her. I will\nemphasize that Dr. Singh will also be looking to optimize her health\nand safety and there are steps that can be taken that don’t involve her\nhaving her driving privileges taken away. I hope that by having an\nopen and honest discussion with my patient, we will be able to speak\nto Dr. Singh and formulate a plan for her ongoing treatment and\nfollow-up. On the other hand, if my patient refuses to speak with Dr.\nSingh, then I will have to tell Dr. Singh myself about the information\nI have heard from her because of the potential harm to my patient\nand others on the road. I will tell the patient that\nI must tell Dr. Singh that she is not taking her medications, as her\nactions can impact her and others’ safety and wellbeing. I will then tell Dr. Singh so that we can plan\nfor minimizing the risks to the patient and the general public, whether\nthat means attempting to talk to her again, or reporting to the state\nor provincial licensing authorities. By emphasizing to her the risks of leaving her\n110\n\nepilepsy untreated, I hope the patient will work with Dr. Singh and\nmyself to create a new treatment plan; however, if she chooses not to,\nI will talk to Dr. Singh so we can work towards minimizing the risks\nto both my patient and the general public.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 3, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\", \"solutions\", \"summary\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

How would you handle this\nsituation, and what would you say to Taylor?\n\nTHEME(S): conflict resolution, professionalism, ethical dilemma\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nIn this scenario, I am a lawyer working alone at a small\nfirm and I have a client, Taylor, who is requesting to see someone else\nbecause of a gender preference. The only lawyer that would meet this\nrequest, Jordan, is currently in court with another client. I am asked\nhow I would handle this situation and what I would say to Taylor. I need to ensure to act in the best interest of the client while\nstill adhering to my ethical obligation and remaining nondiscriminatory towards the team\nFirst, I would go into the waiting room myself and ask Taylor if it\nwould be okay to speak privately in my office. There, I would ask what\nTaylor needed help with and, after listening to the answer, would ask\nif it would be okay for me to help, as I am the only person in the office\nat the moment. It is possible that the person at the front desk\nmisunderstood and that Taylor does not have a gender preference or\nis willing to proceed regardless. However, if Taylor did in fact express\na gender preference, I would ask if Taylor would be comfortable\ndiscussing why. If the reason for the gender preference was not a\nconscious decision, for example, stemming from a past history of\nsexual assault, I would apologize for probing and contact Jordan to\nsee whether it might be possible to accommodate Taylor without\nhaving an undue impact on the other client. Perhaps I could cover for\nJordan in court to mitigate the issue or if that matter is not urgent, we\ncan reschedule a meeting between Taylor and Jordan for another\ndate. If Taylor at any point refused to see me or refused to elaborate,\nthen I would act in the same way because it is possible that Taylor’s\nactions are stemming from a similar reason. On the other hand,\nTaylor may indicate a preference due to a conscious decision based\non long-standing practice, such as cultural or religious reasons. In this case, I would still try my best to\n112\n\naccommodate Taylor, but I would also inquire further about why it\nwas necessary to see a lawyer today and whether another day would\nbe possible without causing undue harm. It is also possible that Taylor\nis making a conscious decision based on bias, such as believing that\nfemale lawyers are less capable.\nIf, after discussing all this at length with Taylor, I felt it was very likely\nthat this was the case, I would still offer to help and also suggest the\npossibility of coming another day. I would also take into account the\nreasoning for why Taylor wanted to see a lawyer today, which could\nrange from a fear for safety in a domestic violence case to simple\nintolerance and a feeling of entitlement. So, on the whole, I would first\ngather more information from Taylor and then, giving Taylor the\nbenefit of doubt, would try my best to determine the rationale and\ntake that into consideration when deciding upon a response,\nparticularly if there were the potential of impacting another client; in\nall cases, I would do my best to help.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 4, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\", \"if/then\", \"solutions\", \"summary\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

The cancer is in its early stages and will likely respond\nvery well to conventional treatment. However, Miss Parker states that\nshe is only interested in “natural” remedies. You are worried that if\nshe does not pursue the recommended treatment, the cancer will\nprogress and become life-threatening. You ask Miss Parker if she has\nspoken with her family regarding the situation, but she states that she\nhas made her own decision and does not want anyone else involved.\nHow would you proceed?\n\nTHEME(S): patient autonomy, informed consent, problem-solving\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nIn this scenario, Miss Parker has been diagnosed with\ncancer and is rejecting the recommended conventional therapy\nwhich has been shown to be very effective. She is only interested in\npursuing natural remedies and does not want to involve her family\nin her decision making. I am concerned about the\nwellbeing of Miss Parker and whether she is making a fully\ninformed decision, and also if she has an appropriate support\nsystem. I would have a private\nconversation with Miss Parker to better understand her decision to\nforego the recommended therapy. Perhaps she is concerned about the potential\nside effects and also about the efficacy of the recommended\ntreatment. I would make sure to educate her fully on the risks,\nbenefits, and alternatives of the treatment that I am\nrecommending, based on scientific research and evidence. I would\nensure she understands the information I have presented to her. I\nwould collaborate with Miss Parker to try to develop a treatment\nplan with which she is comfortable, while also emphasizing the high\nlikelihood of success with the treatment I have recommended, as\nwell as the risk of foregoing this treatment. If she is interested in a\nsecond opinion, I would refer her to a knowledgeable colleague. If, in speaking with Miss Parker, I find that she is\nstruggling emotionally with the diagnosis, I would express my\nunderstanding and make sure she knows I am here to support her. I would also encourage her to refer to her\nsupport system, whether it be family or friends. Furthermore, I\nwould refer her to support groups and additional counseling\nservices. I want to make sure that Miss Parker’s decision not to\npursue treatment is not being clouded by her emotional state. I\nthink she would benefit from a strong support system, but if Miss\nParker does not want to involve her family, then I would have to\nrespect her wishes. Ultimately, if after fully understanding the\ninformation I have presented to her, Miss Parker still wishes to only\npursue natural remedies, I will have to acknowledge that she has\nthe last say in the matter as long as it is clear that she is of sound\nmind and age of maturity.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 5, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\", \"if/then\", \"solutions\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

I will be feeling quite nervous about\ndiscussing this with Lauren and understand that she may be angry\nand upset. I will contact Lauren\nstraight away and arrange to meet with her in person, so I can fully\nexplain what happened. I will make sure I am calm and approach\nLauren by telling her exactly what happened. I will emphasize how\nsorry I am that her new car was damaged. It seems like I got distracted\nby my phone, but I won’t make excuses; rather, I will state that I\nshould not have been distracted by my phone and should have\nconcentrated on driving. I would also want to explain\nto Lauren that I wish to pay for any damages to the car and that I will\ntake care of everything myself, including arranging a rental car for\nLauren while her car is being repaired. Hopefully, I have insurance\nwhich can cover this damage, but if I don’t, I will need to figure out a\nway to pay for the damage I caused. Even though my insurance\npayments may go up, I need to report this accident. If I don’t have insurance, I’ll find a way to\npay for the damages by borrowing money from family and friends or\nusing my credit card because my main concern is to fix Lauren’s car\nwithout any added inconvenience to her. I would want to let Lauren\nexpress how she is feeling to me and understand that she may be\nupset with me. I will take her down to the\ngarage to look at her car and be present as she contacts anyone she\nneeds to, such as her insurance company or a family member. We may also need to contact the building\nmanager to make sure no damage occurred to the pillar in the\nparking garage. I will make sure to try to keep some\ncontact with Lauren over the next few days, while still giving her the\nspace she needs to process this situation. I will also make sure to monitor my own driving in\nthe future. I should be aware that I need to concentrate fully and\navoid using my phone when I am driving.

How would you approach this issue?\n\nTHEME(S): informed consent, patient autonomy, ethical dilemma\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nIn this scenario, the main concern is ensuring that there is\ninformed consent as my patient has been on chronic opioids and\nwould like to stop. However, he is now requesting a prescription for\nmedical marijuana. I need to ensure the wellbeing of the\npatient and deliver effective care. I\nwould want to gather more information on the patient’s condition,\ntake a full patient history, and do an appropriate physical\nexamination, while also ensuring that I understand the latest research\non treating the patient’s condition with medical marijuana. I would ask him\nwhat his concerns are around opioid use and what he has heard in\nthe media. Depending on the situation, I’d like to let my patient know\nthat it’s great that he is motivated to stop using prescription pain\nkillers. Next, I would ensure the patient’s information is accurate; if\nnot, I would provide my knowledge on opioids and pain killers. I\nwould also discuss the risks and benefits of medical marijuana with\nthe patient and assess if he is eligible and would benefit from such\ntreatment. After a thorough assessment and\nphysical exam, if I deem that the patient would be appropriate to trial\nmedical marijuana, I would ensure he is fully capable, informed of the\nrisks/benefits/side effects/alternatives, and this decision is voluntary,\nand then I would either prescribe it to the patient or refer him to a\npain specialist for further assessment/prescription if I feel this is\noutside my scope of practice. Furthermore, if there are other, more\nappropriate medications/exercise/physiotherapy options, I would\noffer that as well. As the patient is on their\npain journey, I would want to ensure proper follow up and have the\npatient book for an appointment in two to three weeks to assess their\npain management and ensure the risks still outweigh the benefits.\n\n119\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 7, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\", \"if/then\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

I have overheard a conversation between the chef and the\nmanager, which suggested that expired food may be being served,\nand which contained disparaging remarks about those in our lowincome neighborhood. The most pressing issue is the\nwellbeing of members of our community. Although I overheard a concerning conversation\nbetween the manager and the chef, I cannot assume anything as I was\nnot a part of the conversation. I would\ndefinitely want to gather more information, as I may have misheard\nthe conversation, or the chef and the manager might have been\nentertaining a distasteful inside joke. I understand that as a new\nemployee I still have lots to learn, but I feel it would be my\nprofessional responsibility to ensure an ethical environment that\nfollows the necessary health and safety policies. I would first speak with the chef\nprivately and inquire about the kitchen items. If the chef informs me\nthat some items have a long-standing shelf life, I would want to make\nsure that they are still good to serve. If I do find what the chef tells me\nto be concerning, then I would follow up with the manager. In a nonjudgmental manner, I would approach the manager and inform him\nthat I overheard the conversation and already followed up with the\nchef to clarify. I\nwould state my concerns about the health and safety regulations, and\nhow that can affect the health of the customers. Additionally, I would discuss the\ndistasteful comments made towards individuals in the neighborhood.\nIf the manager clarifies that it was a joke, and the items would not be\nused, then I would encourage the manager to be respectful towards\nthe population they are serving and to not encourage such banter\nbecause if this joke is overheard by others, it may damage our\nreputation. If, however, I believe that the manager and/or the chef\ncontinue to act unethically and do not seem remorseful, I will be\nforced to report this anonymously to the local health inspection\nagency authorities who will be best suited to investigate immediately.\nIn the meantime, I’ll try my best to make sure customers are not\n\n121\n\nserved any expired items or that they are aware of such instances.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 8, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

You are now tasked with\nmediating this situation. How do you go about doing so?\n\nTHEME(S): Conflict resolution, professionalism\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nIn the presented scenario, I observed early on that the\npatient and their respective family members quickly resort to\ndismissiveness upon the arrival of the attending physician. This\ninherently hinders the degree of communication between the patient\nand the medical team. Furthermore, I am asked to find a replacement\nsurgeon to take over the patient’s case, as the patient and their family\nare refusing to be under the care of a physician that they consider to\n123\n\nbe of a multicultural background. In this situation, the request\nof the family member appears to indicate that the patient and family\nare demonstrating an inherent degree of racial bias against this\nphysician. However, I want to make sure that I’m not making any\nassumptions and make sure that the patient or the family have not\nhad legitimate previous negative encounters with the physician. In\nany event, my main priority is to ensure the best care for the patient. I would first acknowledge that I have\nheard the patient’s concerns and proceed to ask why they would be\nmore comfortable seeking the care of another physician given that the\nphysician is perfectly suited and has the expertise to care for the\npatient.

How would you\nhandle this situation, and what would you say to Blake?\n\nTHEME(S): non-judgmental approach, conflict resolution\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nIn this scenario, I have hosted a party and accidentally\nrecommended my homemade sugar cookies, which contain animal\nproducts, to Blake, a vegetarian attending the party. Blake likes the\ncookies and asks for the recipe. I am asked how I would handle this\nsituation and what I would say to Blake. First, I would try to\nconfirm if Blake is indeed a vegetarian since it seems like I may have\nlearned this second-hand. I would call Blake and confirm that it is an\nappropriate time to talk. After asking how Blake is doing, I would\nmention that I have a concern regarding the party and then ask\nwhether it was true that Blake is a vegetarian.\nIt is possible that my friend was simply mistaken, in which case there’s\nnot cause for concern and continued discussion. On the other hand,\nit is possible that Blake is a vegetarian, the reasons for which could\nrange from personal conviction to religious principles to medical\ndietary restrictions. However, regardless of the reason, if that’s the\ncase, I would tell Blake that I made a mistake when I mentioned that\nthe cookies would be okay to eat, and I would apologize profusely for\ndoing so. I would explain what happened, including the\nspecific reason for the mistake, perhaps stemming from my lack of\nfamiliarity with lard. It is possible that Blake is not particularly\ndisturbed by the news, perhaps not always strictly adhering to a\nvegetarian diet. On the other hand, it is also possible that Blake may\nbecome upset. In this case, I would continue to apologize and ask if\nthere were anything I could do, recognizing that I may not be able to\nmake up for my mistake. I would attempt to comfort Blake; for\nexample, if dietary restrictions were due to religious reasons, I would\nmention the importance of considering intent and highlight that\nBlake was ignorant of the content of the cookies despite due diligence\ndone by asking me to clarify. I would also explain that I am still willing\nto send the recipe, but that it would be necessary for Blake to\nsubstitute vegetable shortening for the lard. Finally, I would discuss\n126\n\nthe steps I would take to prevent this sort of mistake in the future,\nincluding double-checking ingredients before offering any dietary\nsuggestions. My decision to continue pursuing the conversation\nwould depend on whether or not I felt that I was being successful in\nmaking Blake feel better. Although I understand that Blake may\navoid feeling upset if not told the truth, I believe it would be worse to\nlie, even if it were a lie of omission. I believe that Blake has the right\nto the truth and that, in this case, failing to disclose the truth would\nmore likely result in preventing an uncomfortable situation for myself\nrather than avoiding harm to Blake. Furthermore, if there’s a dietary\nmedical concern, it is my responsibility to let Blake know immediately. However, if I were absolutely sure that Blake\nwould come to serious harm based on this knowledge, for example, if\nreligious practices dictated a painful punishment regardless of intent\nor ignorance, then I would consider withholding the information and,\nafter discussing with an authority figure in the same religion as Blake, I might\ndecide not to disclose. However, I would still take steps to prevent this\nmistake in the future.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 10, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"if/then\", \"solutions\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

As her physician, what\nwould you advise Mariam to do? What are your views on this policy?\n\nTHEME(S): patient autonomy, informed consent, medical-legal,\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nThis question addresses the recently-legalized procedure\nof medically-assisted end-of-life treatment in a particular jurisdiction.\nHowever, one of the issues that has arisen with the law is the\n128\n\nrequirement of consent right up to the moment before the procedure\nis administered. Although this provision was implemented\nwith good intention as a safeguard and to respect patient autonomy,\nunfortunately, it has had a negative effect on patients who are\nsuffering with progressive diseases that may leave them incapable of\nproviding consent right before the procedure. Currently, the law is\nbeing challenged and the proposed solution to this would be to allow\npatients to sign a legal document providing advanced consent to\nreceive the treatment when their condition has deteriorated to a\ncertain point; however, this currently is not legal and also raises\nchallenges with regard to subjective evaluations in determining when\na disease has reached a certain stage. As her physician,\nmy main concern is the wellbeing and quality of life of my patient. I would have a conversation with Mariam and\nher family about the options. I would want to know when she was\ndiagnosed and how long she has had the disease, the rate of\ndeterioration to this point, and the estimated time she may have left. I would consult the literature\nand look at the general trends for people living with ALS from the\ntime of diagnosis to the time of death and the rate of decline in\nbetween.\nWeighing this against Mariam’s current situation, I would inform her\nof all the available evidence and timelines and discuss her options,\nkeeping in mind that no two patients will respond exactly the same. I would also let Mariam know that she can\nappoint a family member to act on her behalf in the event of mental\nincapacitation, if such policies are available in this jurisdiction. While\nI certainly wouldn’t want Mariam to have to end her life any earlier\nthan she felt she had to, I would also respect Mariam’s patient\nautonomy, her desire to avoid extreme suffering, and her right to\nselect the medical option she feels is best for her. As her physician, it’s\nnot my place to persuade or dissuade Mary on a medical procedure,\nbut rather to provide her with all the evidence and legal options\navailable to her at this time. When I feel Mary is fully informed and\nhad a chance to discuss it with her family, I would allow Mary to make\nher decision and I would respect the decision she reached.\n\n129\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 11, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"if/then\", \"solutions\", \"summary\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

The\nprofessor asks the student to\nparticipate in a research study about adapting to the “Western world.”\nI observe that the student seems reluctant to participate, but he\nultimately agrees and then later confides in me that he doesn’t really\nwant to but felt pressured to do so in order to maintain a good\nrelationship with the professor. This raises an ethical issue\nabout participant consent and coercion. There are clear ethical\nguidelines that indicate proper participant recruitment and consent,\nand that there should be no coercion or power imbalance between the\nresearcher and participant. The professor is in a position of power\nand, as a result, the student did not feel that they had a choice to freely\ndecide if they wanted to participate.\nI need to ensure the wellbeing of my fellow graduate student, and that\nprofessional boundaries are not crossed within the lab and during the\nresearch study. However, I would\nneed to gather more information and I would speak to the student\nand ask them how they would feel about speaking to the professor\nabout it, if they were uncomfortable, I would encourage them to do\nso and offer my support to go with them. I could also tell the student that I am willing to\nspeak to the professor as well, in order to bring up the ethical issue\nbecause, as a research lab, we need to ensure we are acting ethically\nand in accordance with Research Ethics Board guidelines. We\nwould also not want to create a negative environment where power\n131\n\nimbalances exist and people are made to feel uncomfortable. I would\nrequest to meet with the supervisor privately and, in a nonconfrontational way, explain that I witnessed the interaction between\nJacob and wanted to raise a concern about participant recruitment\nand consent. I would explain to the professor that Jacob indicated his\nreluctance about participating in the study and wanted to bring that\nto the professor’s attention, as perhaps he wasn’t aware of this. If the\nprofessor acknowledges the issue and speaks to Jacob about it and\nallows Jacob to freely decide, then no further action is necessary. If\nthe professor brushes off the issue and pushes to have Jacob\nparticipate, then I would remind the professor that he is a role model\nand he is mentoring the next generation of researchers and, as such,\nit is important to set a good example. If he still persisted, then I would\ninform the professor that I believe this is an ethical violation and that\nI would need to report it to the university’s research ethics board if\nthe professor persists. Furthermore, I understand that such an action\nmight damage my working relationship with this professor but I’m\nconfident that I will be able to find a new supervisor given the\ncircumstance.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 12, \"archetype\": \"scenario\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"One-sentence recap + clarify missing facts\", \"Stakeholders + competing values\", \"Emotions (yours + others) and how you would regulate them\", \"Principles (safety, autonomy, beneficence, fairness, confidentiality where relevant)\", \"Options (at least 2) with pros/cons and tradeoffs\", \"Recommendation + immediate next steps\", \"Reflection: what you'd do differently next time / what you'd learn\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

In my office, the\nstudent has an emotional reaction and expresses fears that an\nacademic integrity hearing might compromise her ability to graduate\nat the end of the term. As the professor, I need to ensure the\nwellbeing of my students, while acting in accordance with ethics. The first thing I would want to do\nis continue my private conversation with the student, to better\nunderstand what happened. In a non-confrontational manner, I\nwould ask the student about the main claims of her paper, and where\nshe got the ideas/support for those claims. I would ask the student if\nshe was familiar with the text that was copied verbatim. I want to gauge the student’s response to see if there is an\n134\n\nindication of foreknowledge of wrongdoing. After this, I would show\nthe copied material from the original text to the student and ask if she\nrealizes that she copied this material, without following proper\nquotation or citation procedures. I would let the student know that\nthis constitutes a violation of academic integrity and provide time for\nexplanations or possible emotional reactions. As I do not yet know if\nintentional wrongdoing was committed, I would try to be\nunderstanding and compassionate, while still maintaining the\nstandards of academic integrity. I would\nask the student if she’d ever been reported for a violation of academic\nintegrity before, or if anyone had ever spoken to her about her\nwriting. Once the student had explained herself, I would thank her\nfor her time and let her know that I would follow up within a few days.\nI would then consult colleagues or the chair of my department for\nadvice, especially if this was my first case of potential plagiarism. I would also review my school’s process for academic\nintegrity hearings and standards of academic integrity to refresh my\nmemory of the procedure. Ultimately,\nfollowing the advice of others, and with an understanding of the\nschool’s policy, I would forward the necessary information to the\nAcademic Integrity Office, knowing that if this was a first offense, the\nstudent will receive relatively lenient treatment, and that this will\nlikely not compromise the student’s graduation, but will likely result\nin a zero or reduced mark for the assignment. If it turns out that this\nwas an oversight and the student had genuinely forgotten to cite the\nwork appropriately, then while her grade might be affected, there\nwould be no need to penalize her for plagiarism. If this was\nintentional, then it needs to be brought to the attention of proper\nauthorities within the university to make sure students advance based\non their academic ability, not plagiarism.\nFollow up response: While this would leave me feeling a\nbit conflicted about my previous sympathy for the student, since she\nsaid she’d not been to an academic integrity hearing before, I would\nremain as non-judgmental as possible, while still holding firm to the\nprinciples of academic honesty. If possible, I\nwould like to gather more information about the previous cases by\nasking the committee if they can disclose such information to me.\n135\n\nWhile the student was outside the room, I would consult with other\nmembers of the group to determine what they thought the best course\nof action was, since they have a wealth of experience in such matters. If the punishment fit the violation, I would support\nthe other members of the group in their decision. However, we must\nremain cognizant that past behavior does not automatically allow us\nto assume similar behavior in this situation. It is critical that we judge\nthis case on its own and rule out an honest mistake before making a\ndecision.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 13, \"archetype\": \"acting\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"identifies most pressing issue\", \"compassion\", \"informationgathering\", \"empathy\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Open with empathy + calm tone\", \"Clarify facts and goals; ask permission to discuss\", \"Name feelings; validate; avoid judgment\", \"Offer options; agree on a plan; check understanding\", \"Close with support + follow-up plan\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

I decided to set\nup a time to discuss the concern with my supervisor in private. Once at the meeting, in a\nvery professional and respectful manner, I explained my concerns\nand allowed my supervisor to take the lead in explaining why he felt\nso strongly about his approach. It was important to listen to his views\nbecause I understood that he is certainly more experienced than I am\nwhen it comes to the field and, perhaps, I may have missed something\nimportant. After listening to his rationale and ideas, I was\ncertainly influenced and, although I provided my perspective,\nrationale, and evidence for why I thought a different approach was\nneeded, at the end of the meeting I was able to see the shortcoming\nin my approach and luckily this was corrected prior to the\npresentation. We eventually came to a new consensus and drew upon\na hybrid approach that integrated both of our ideas and perspectives. This was a great learning experience for me\nas it taught me a valuable lesson about how to resolve disagreements\nwith colleagues and supervisors. Moving forward, I will\ncertainly resolve conflicts in a professional manner and always seek to\nunderstand the perspective of others first before making any rash\ndecisions, so I can continue to grow as an individual and as a\nprofessional.\n138\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 14, \"archetype\": \"personal\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"clear structure\", \"balanced reasoning\", \"professional tone\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Answer directly in 1 sentence\", \"Personal story/experience (concrete)\", \"What you learned/grew\", \"Link to medicine values (service, humility, curiosity, integrity)\", \"Close with a forward-looking line\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

How\ndid you resolve the argument?\n\nTHEME(S): N/A\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nThe last argument I had with a friend was a growing\nexperience. My friend Jessica and I have been\nfriends for over 10 years. In that time, we established effective ways to\nreconcile, should either of us be angry with one another. One summer, I realized that Jessica became\ndistant. Of course, this made me upset, and I mistakenly approached\nher in an accusatory tone for neglecting our friendship without first\ngathering more information. Jessica, in turn, became upset and\nstopped talking to me. However, I was not willing to let one\nmisunderstanding get in the way of our friendship. I wanted to see\nwhat was going on with Jessica – perhaps she was going through some\npersonal issues and I needed to support her before making any\nconclusions. Therefore, I approached Jessica again and\nasked her to have a conversation with me, so I could gather more\ninformation. After talking to Jessica, I realized that Jessica’s family was\nstruggling financially, and this was the reason she had been distant\nlately. I apologized to Jessica for being judgmental earlier and offered\nto support her. What I learned from this\nexperience is that the best way to resolve any conflict is to remain nonjudgmental and gather as many facts as possible before making any\nconclusions. Someone might be upset due to other factors unknown\nto me and if I don’t gather more information, I might mistakenly\nassume that their emotions are directed at me. This is a\nskill I have continued to refine over time and will continue to apply\nin my future.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 16, \"archetype\": \"written\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"maturity\", \"ability to communicate\", \"compassion\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Positive framing + ownership\", \"Describe what happened (briefly) and what you felt\", \"What you did to resolve it (specific)\", \"What you learned; how you'd prevent recurrence\", \"Maintain professional tone\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

Go inside the room and discuss\nyour thoughts with the interviewer.\n\nTHEME(S): N/A\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nA quote by Socrates can be interpreted in many different\nways, and this can be possibly influenced by your upbringing and/or\ncurrent social environment. However, for\nmyself, I believe that the first part, “education is the kindling of the\nflame,” can suggest that education, be it learning formally, in an\nacademic setting, or through your personal experiences, can truly\nmotivate as referenced by the “kindling flame” – that is, lighting a fire\nof inspiration. For example, when I was\nback-packing through Europe, I came across a French writer, who\ntaught me the importance of storytelling. Through this experience I\nbecame drawn to story- tellers, looking for ways they attempted to\nengage with the audience and ways they drew on different emotions.\nThis entire experience motivated me to learn more about history and\nalso allowed me to appreciate the history of storytellers and their role\nin singlehandedly taking on one of the most monumental aspects of\nmaintaining cultural rituals and traditions. The second part of the quote states, “not the filling of a\nvessel.” For this part, I feel that perhaps Socrates is suggesting that\ninformation learned or gained is not simply a means to an end. The\nvessel can be representative of our brain, and how much we can\nobserve. If gaining knowledge is not simply to fill up our brains, then\nperhaps that can suggest that there is always room to learn, always\n143\n\nroom to grow. An\nexample of this was in my first year as an undergrad; as a studious\nindividual, I felt that I already had the most effective studying habits\nin place. However, when I became overwhelmed with the workload,\nI quickly had to get involved in a study group. Through the process, I learned of\nother ways to interpret knowledge and to truly understand, such as\npresenting key ideas to a group about a topic you’re unfamiliar with\n– something that forced me to condense ideas and learn more\nthoroughly and effectively throughout the process. In summary, in this\nquote, Socrates suggests that education is meant to spark one’s\ninterest in learning more without any limitations or end goal in mind.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 17, \"archetype\": \"quote\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"summary\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Interpret the quote in your own words\", \"Agree/disagree with nuance\", \"Example(s) from experience or real world\", \"Counterpoint/limitations\", \"Practical takeaway\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

I think we can accomplish this task pretty\nwell if we communicate clearly with each other. Therefore, as I\ndescribe the image, if at any point you have any questions, feel free to\nask me to pause and provide further clarification. First, I need to ensure that\nyou have the following materials: standard 8 x 11 paper, a black pen\nor pencil, and a ruler. Let me know once you have those items. If any\nof these items have not been provided to you, let me know so I can\nadjust my instructions. Since the figures are geometric, we can easily\nuse the XY Cartesian coordinate system. Just so you have an overall\nidea of what we’re drawing, the image contains two geometric shapes,\none rectangle and one square. These shapes are connected, with the\nrectangle oriented horizontally on top and the square on the bottom\nbut hanging off to the right of the rectangle. Don’t worry, I’m going\nto walk you through the details of this. First hold your 8 x 11 paper\nvertically. To construct an XY Cartesian coordinate system, you will\nfirst need to draw a line on the left side of the page going down\nvertically that will be our Y axis. At the bottom of that line, draw\nanother line to the right horizontally, this will be our X axis. At the\npoint where both these points meet, that is our origin, label that 0. Let me know once you have\ncompleted that or if you have any questions before we continue. Now please number both the X and Y axis\nby dividing them to 1 cm segments, creating five segments horizontally and five vertically – so,\n5x5 cm – labeled 1-5, beginning at the zero and working up and then\nfrom zero to the right. Please let me know when you’ve completed\nthis. I am now going to provide you with specific points on the\ncoordinate system that we will later use to create our two objects. First\nfind X0 and Y2 and label that as point “A.”\nThe second point is X3, Y2, label that B. Now with a straight black\nline connect A to B. Third point, X3, Y4, label that C, and then\nconnect B to C. Fourth point, X0, Y4, label that D, and connect with\n146\n\na straight line to C and back to A. You should now have a rectangle.\nNow for the second figure: mark a point at X2, Y0, label that E. Mark\na point at X4, Y0, label that F, and connect E to F. Mark a point at X4\nand Y2, label that G. Go ahead and connect F to G. Our final point is\nH, please mark a point at X2, Y2. Ensure to connect G to H and finally\nH to E. This should give you a square. What you should have is two\nfigures, one a rectangle, and the second a square which is connected\nto the bottom right part of the first rectangle. Let me know if you have\nany questions or need me to clarify.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 18, \"archetype\": \"picture\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"recap\", \"collaborative approach\", \"summary\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Set collaboration protocol (pause/clarify)\", \"Give high-level overview first\", \"Step-by-step with checkpoints\", \"Use consistent reference system (coordinates, landmarks)\", \"Summarize and verify\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

What\nare your views about this idea?\n\nTHEME(S): N/A\n\nCANDIDATE ANSWER:\nI can understand why such a fee would be introduced.\nThis would essentially act as a deterrent fee and make individuals\nreconsider when it is essential to go to the doctor or the hospital and\nwhen it is not. The healthcare system is definitely under a lot of\nfinancial stress, especially as a result of our aging population and the\nincreased need for services. There are pros and cons associated with\nsuch a policy. First, as I already\nmentioned, this $10 fee would act as a deterrent and perhaps prevent\nunnecessary visits to the doctor’s office and the ER. This would take\nsome of the burden off of our healthcare system and generate funds,\nwhich can be used towards improving our healthcare system; but, of\ncourse, this hypothesis will need to be objectively validated.\nWith that said, the problem with such a policy arises when the\ndeterrent fee acts as a barrier to seeking care for those who come from\na lower socioeconomic stratum of society. For some, a $10 fee may be\na major demand and, as a result, they may not seek out help from\ntheir doctors even in times when it is genuinely necessary. This can end up creating more costs for the healthcare\nsystem in the long run because, as conditions become more chronic\n148\n\nover time, the cost required to appropriately address such health\nconditions increases.\nTherefore, we may be saving in doctor visits in the short run through\nsuch a fee, but it can end up costing us a lot later down the line. I do\nnot believe implementing a deterrent fee as a means of reducing the\nstress on the healthcare system is a good idea. We can explore other\navenues to reduce the burden on our system. For instance, we can\neducate the general public about the appropriate use of healthcare\nservices and when it is required to seek out help from doctors or the\nER. As well, implementing or encouraging tools such as tele-health\nand/or web-health services, where individuals can contact a healthcare\nprofessional for advice over the Internet, are great examples of how\ntechnologies can be used to educate the population. We should also\nbe more focused on preventative measures as a long-term solution to\ndealing with the demands that our healthcare system is facing. This\nrequires mass education of the population about a healthy and active\nliving lifestyle, which in the long run will reduce the total number of\nindividuals who will need to seek out medical care throughout their\nlife.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 19, \"archetype\": \"policy\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"clear structure\", \"balanced reasoning\", \"professional tone\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Define the policy problem and goal\", \"Stakeholders and equity impacts\", \"Options (2–3) with pros/cons, feasibility, unintended consequences\", \"Recommendation + mitigation + implementation plan\", \"How you'd evaluate success (metrics/time horizon)\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}

More recently, certain states and countries have reformed their\npolicies and legalized recreational marijuana. There are many advantages and\ndisadvantages when exploring this topic. In terms of advantages, we\ncan consider multiple perspectives. For example, when considering\nthose individuals that indulge in recreational marijuana, often these\nindividuals access such substances in dangerous environments that\nmay compromise their safety. Legalizing marijuana will reduce the\nrisk and harm potentially caused to these individuals. This can also combat the\ncurrent opioid crisis by bringing in alternative pain management\noptions. Secondly, when considering those individuals currently\nincarcerated for possession or selling of marijuana, this new policy can\nhelp in reducing the incarceration rates. Research suggests that most\nof these offenders leave prison in a worse state than they would be in\nif they were not imprisoned, mainly because they become exposed to\nmore severe criminals. Not only is this costly for the community, but\nthis will allow authorities to focus on criminal activity that is most\nconsequential. Additionally, legalizing marijuana can allow the\ngovernment to better control the substance distribution and thus\ngenerate profit, which can go back to the communities. On the other hand, there are\nmany disadvantages to this policy. For example, substance abuse is\nstill harmful, and there is research that suggests long-term abuse can\nlead to anxiety or schizophrenic disorders. Additionally, regulating\n150\n\nrecreational marijuana will be a challenging task and can compromise\nthe safety of the community. Lastly, legalizing marijuana can be\nharmful to the youth and even children as there will be a greater\naccess to the substance. When it comes to legalizing marijuana,\nI do support the policy.\nHowever, I think we need to better educate the community, and even\nmore so the youth, on the use and abuse of the substance.\nAdditionally, we need to ensure we have better regulations in place to\nnot compromise the safety of the public. Lastly, we need to do further\nresearch on the long-term effects of marijuana abuse to ensure we are\nprepared.\n\nReturn JSON with keys: station_id, archetype, overall_score_0_to_10, rubric_0_to_2_each, what_worked, what_to_improve, recommended_signpost_framework, micro_upgrade."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"station_id\": 20, \"archetype\": \"policy\", \"overall_score_0_to_10\": 10.0, \"rubric_0_to_2_each\": {\"structure\": 2, \"empathy\": 2, \"information_gathering\": 2, \"reasoning\": 2, \"professionalism\": 2}, \"what_worked\": [\"clear structure\", \"balanced reasoning\", \"professional tone\"], \"what_to_improve\": [], \"recommended_signpost_framework\": [\"Define the policy problem and goal\", \"Stakeholders and equity impacts\", \"Options (2–3) with pros/cons, feasibility, unintended consequences\", \"Recommendation + mitigation + implementation plan\", \"How you'd evaluate success (metrics/time horizon)\"], \"micro_upgrade\": \"To push this from strong to exceptional: add one clarifying question, mention one potential unintended consequence, and end with a crisp closing sentence.\"}"}]}
